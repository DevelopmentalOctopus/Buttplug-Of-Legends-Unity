# Buttplug-Of-Legends-Unity

This is an app based on https://github.com/kinkyacedev/buttplug-of-legends

It monitors your League of Legends gameplay and creates a score based on the actions you perform, like killing enemies/destroying turrets. 
Then that score is used to control the connected devices (device intensity is maxed when at 100 points or more).

Steps:
1. Open Intiface
2. Open this app and click connect
3. Play League of Legends
